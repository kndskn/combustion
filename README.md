# CFD 

**This repo contains scripts which helps to process data from OpenFOAM.**

At this work I try to model streams (isotherm at beginning). After modelling, I make averaging of it and compare with experimental data. Soon I will model combustion chamber based on this isotherm flow.  

* Here you can find main files which contains choosing parameters which you can change in graphs.

* Also here is parameters file, where you can change parameters of averaging and calculations of streams.

* Other files contains scripts which make calculations and graphs.

* *exp_data* folder contains data to compare from experiment.
